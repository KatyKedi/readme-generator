The ISC License is basically a ‘stripped down’ version of the MIT licenses and simplified BSD 2-Clause licenses, removing some language that is no longer necessary. The ISC open source license is functional equivalent to the MIT License. The only difference lies in the license language. The ISC License has only two requirements and they are the same as those of the MIT License. Users must include the original copyright notice and a copy of the license itself while copying or modifying the licensed code. ISC permissive license users are free to use the code commercially, modify the code and distribute the code.
